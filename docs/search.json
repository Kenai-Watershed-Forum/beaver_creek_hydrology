    "text": "Preface\nIn Spring 2022, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a partnership with Kenai Watershed Forum (KWF) with support from the Alaska Climate Action Science Center (AK CASC). The project will investigate hydrological conditions in the Beaver Creek watershed, a lowland tributary of the Kenai River. The project will use present-day data on water temperature, discharge, and landscape characteristics to model future conditions under future scenarios of climate conditions and groundwater usage.\nThis document is a draft in progress and is for use only in disseminating information among the research team. All data is preliminary and has not been approved for use in publications by USGS or any other entity, as of 2023-04-18.\nFor more details visit https://www.kenaiwatershed.org/water-research-news/usgs-beaver-creek/."

    "text": "1.1 Water Temperature Loggers\n\n1.1.1 Locations\nOur project includes water temperature data from a total of fifteen locations throughout the Beaver Creek watershed. In summer 2022 we established thirteen sites to monitor water temperature with HOBO TempPro v2 loggers, in addition to the one site previously established by Kenai Watershed Forum. The USGS Alaska Science Center also established a real-time gauging station in the lower reach, which records water temperature in addition to discharge. These data (station # 15266500) are available online at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/15266500/.\nSite locations and other metadata are available for download in the link below.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Temperature Logger Site Metadata for USGS / KWF Beaver Creek Hydrology Project\n\n\n\nAn ArcGIS Online map of site locations is displayed below. The map may also be accessed at https://arcg.is/0ySarv1.\n\n\n\nView larger map\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Water Temperature Logger QA/QC Checks\n\n1.1.2.1 Pre-deployment\nPrior to deployment, all water temperature loggers undergo a QA/QC check as described in (Mauger et al. 2015).\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Site Checks\nContent TBD here.\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Post-deployment\nWe downloaded data from all loggers in September/October 2022, and reviewed it in Spring 2023. Each logger’s time series was visually inspected in an R Shiny plot for data that is non-representative of stream channel conditions, such as exposure to air or burial in sand.\nSegments of each time series identified as non-representative of stream channel conditions were flagged in a seperate csv file, then applied to flag and remove these segments.\nAn example plot for one logger is shown below, with flagged data in red and retained data in black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecords for time periods flagged for individual loggers are recorded and available to view at the download below.\n\n\nDownload Temperature Logger Flagged Data Records\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Preliminary Water Temperature Data\nWater temperature will be applied as part of ongoing watershed-scale modeling efforts. At a later stage, it will be housed in a public repository such as AKTEMP (https://aktemp.uaa.alaska.edu) and others.\nPreliminary water temperature files are available for download at the link below.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Zip File of Post-QA/QC Water Temperature Logger Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMauger, Sue, Rebecca Shaftel, E Jamie Trammell, Marcus Geist, and Dan Bogan. 2015. “Stream Temperature Data Collection Standards for Alaska: Minimum Standards to Generate Data Useful for Regional-Scale Analyses.” Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4, Part B (September): 431–38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.07.008."
