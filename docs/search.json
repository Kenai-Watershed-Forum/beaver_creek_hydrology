    "text": "Preface\nIn Spring 2022, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a partnership with Kenai Watershed Forum (KWF) with support from the Alaska Climate Action Science Center (AK CASC). The project will investigate hydrological conditions in the Beaver Creek watershed, a lowland tributary of the Kenai River. The project will use present-day data on water temperature, discharge, and landscape characteristics to model future conditions under future scenarios of climate conditions and groundwater usage.\nThis document is a draft in progress and is for use only in disseminating information among the research team. All data is preliminary and has not been approved for use in publications by USGS or any other entity.\nThe research team includes the following personnel:\n\nDr. Joshua Koch- USGS Alaska Science Center\nMegan Haserodt- USGS Upper Midwest Water Science Center\nAndrew Leaf - USGS Upper Midwest Water Science Center\nBenjamin Meyer- Kenai Watershed Forum\n\nFor more details visit https://www.kenaiwatershed.org/water-research-news/usgs-beaver-creek/."

    "text": "1.1 Water Temperature Loggers\n\n1.1.1 Locations\nOur project includes water temperature data from a total of fifteen locations throughout the Beaver Creek watershed. In summer 2022 we established thirteen new sites to monitor water temperature with HOBO TempPro v2 loggers, in addition to the one site previously established by Kenai Watershed Forum. The USGS Alaska Science Center also established a real-time gauging station in the lower reach, which records water temperature in addition to discharge (station # 15266500). These data are available online at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/15266500/.\nSite locations and other metadata are available for download in the link below.\n\n\nDownload Temperature Logger Site Metadata for USGS / KWF Beaver Creek Hydrology Project\n\n\n\nAn ArcGIS Online map of site locations is displayed below. The map may also be accessed at https://arcg.is/0ySarv1.\n\n\n\nView larger map\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Water Temperature Logger QA/QC Checks\n\n1.1.2.1 Pre-deployment\nPrior to deployment, all water temperature loggers undergo a QA/QC check using ice-water and room temperature water as described in (Mauger et al. 2015).\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Site Checks\nContent TBD here.\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Post-deployment\n\n\n1.1.2.3.1 Fall 2022 Site Visits\nWe downloaded data from all loggers in September/October 2022, and reviewed it in Spring 2023. Each logger’s time series was visually inspected in an R Shiny plot for data that is non-representative of stream channel conditions, such as exposure to air or burial in sand.\nSegments of each time series that were identified as non-representative were flagged in a separate csv file, then applied in order to remove these segments.\nAn example plot for one logger is shown below, with flagged data in red and retained data in black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecords for time periods flagged for individual loggers are recorded and available to view at the download below.\n\n\nDownload Temperature Logger Flagged Data Records from Fall 2022 QA/QC\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2.3.2 Spring / Summer 2023 Site Visits\nAll water temperature logger sites were revisited in Spring / Summer 2023, and log files were downloaded from each logger. The process QA/QC described from Fall 2022 was applied in an identical fashion. QA/QC files are available in the project’s GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Download Preliminary Water Temperature Data\nWater temperature will be applied as part of ongoing watershed-scale modeling efforts. At a later stage, it will be housed in a public repository such as AKTEMP (https://aktemp.uaa.alaska.edu) and others.\nPreliminary water temperature files are available for download at the link below.\n[NOTE: the long-term KWF logger site, also labeled “beaver_creek_usgs_temp_3” in this download, has a pair of twin loggers at one location.]\n\n\nDownload Zip File of Post-QA/QC Water Temperature Logger Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMauger, Sue, Rebecca Shaftel, E Jamie Trammell, Marcus Geist, and Dan Bogan. 2015. “Stream Temperature Data Collection Standards for Alaska: Minimum Standards to Generate Data Useful for Regional-Scale Analyses.” Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4, Part B (September): 431–38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.07.008."

    "text": "3.1 Water Temperature Metrics and Anadromous Habitat\nHydrology model outputs from this project will provide spatially explicit projections of possible future discharge and temperature conditions for Beaver Creek under scenarios of climate change and groundwater withdrawal. We anticipate that discharge and temperature will vary by scenario in ways meaningful to aquatic habitat throughout Beaver Creek. We intend to evaluate these predictions against criteria found in the literature to help understand potential effects on fish, particularly anadromous (e.g. salmonid) species.\nThe following is a discussion of potentially relevant water temperature metrics. Depending on the time scale of model outputs, some metrics may be more applicable than others.\n\n3.1.1 Water Temperature Metrics\nA suite of over fifty distinct temperature metrics may be calculated using an existing R script published in Appendix B of 2013 USGS report focused on cold-water streams in the Nevada desert [Falke, Dunham, and Mills (2013)]1.\nThe list of 52 metrics each fall in to one of the following five categories:\n\nMagnitude\nVariation\nFrequency\nDuration\nTiming\n\nFrom this list, researchers in (Mauger et al. 2017) chose three specific metrics to evaluate when considering regional-scale variations of lotic freshwater thermal regimes in the Cook Inlet region:\n\n“We selected three metrics to describe aspects of the summer temperature regimes in the 48 streams: mean July temperature, maximum weekly average temperature (MWAT), and maximum weekly maximum temperature (MWMT). We chose mean July stream temperature because this is typically the hottest month in southcentral Alaska. We calculated mean July temperature only for site-years when at least 90% of the days were captured (&gt;27 days). We used MWAT and MWMT because they represent an intermediate time period over which transient high temperatures may affect fitness in aquatic organisms.\n\nResearchers focusing on stream temperatures in the nearby Mat-Su valley region used a cluster analysis to characterize thermal regimes using a different subset of descriptors (Shaftel et al. 2020):\n\n[We used] … metrics that represent the magnitude, variability, frequency, duration, and timing of temperature events related to salmon life histories. We used cluster analysis to characterize thermal regimes present in the Matanuska-Susitna (Mat-Su) Basin based on 10 nonredundant temperature metrics and identified the most important drivers of our thermal regimes using random forests.\n\nBoth of these manuscripts focused on southcentral Alaska temperature regimes are relevant to our work focused on Beaver Creek, but are focused on distinguishing and decribing thermal regimes rather than specifically on biological effects on anadromous species.\nMeyer et al. used a bioenergetics modeling approach to evaluate potential effects of water temperature and food consumption on summer growth rates of juvenile Chinook and coho salmon in the Kenai River watershed (Meyer et al. 2023).\n\n3.1.1.1 State and Federal Water Temperature Mangement Criteria\n\nADEC Values\nEPA values\n\nA basic potential approach – for each stream segment under each scenario (climate/flow/time period), evaluate the total proportion of time spent above state & federal criteria value. Likely to see meaningful spatial variation.\n[Work in progress here.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalke, J A, Jason B Dunham, and Amy Mills. 2013. “Variability in Summer Stream Temperatures in Nevada: Implications for Monitoring and Assessment.” Carson City, NV.\n\n\nMauger, Sue, Rebecca Shaftel, Jason C Leppi, and Daniel J Rinella. 2017. “Summer Temperature Regimes in Southcentral Alaska Streams: Watershed Drivers of Variation and Potential Implications for Pacific Salmon.” Can.
