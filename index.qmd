# Preface {.unnumbered}

In Spring 2022, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a partnership with Kenai Watershed Forum (KWF) with support from the [Alaska Climate Action Science Center](https://akcasc.org/) (AK CASC). The project will investigate hydrological conditions in the Beaver Creek watershed, a lowland tributary of the Kenai River. The project will use present-day data on water temperature, discharge, and landscape characteristics to model future conditions under future scenarios of climate conditions and groundwater usage.
