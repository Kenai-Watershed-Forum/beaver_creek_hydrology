In summer 2022 we established thirteen sites to monitor water temperature with HOBO TempPro v2 loggers, in addition to the one site previously established by Kenai Watershed Forum. The USGS Alaska Science Center also established a real-time discharge monitoring station, which records water temperature in addition to discharge.\nSite location and other metadata are available for download in the link below.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Temperature Logger Site Metadata for USGS / KWF Beaver Creek Hydrology Project\n\n\n\nAn ArcGIS Online map of site locations is displayed below.

    "text": "Preface\nIn Spring 2022, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a partnership with Kenai Watershed Forum (KWF) with support from the Alaska Climate Action Science Center (AK CASC). The project will investigate hydrological conditions in the Beaver Creek watershed, a lowland tributary of the Kenai River. The project will use present-day data on water temperature, discharge, and landscape characteristics to model future conditions under future scenarios of climate conditions and groundwater usage.\nThis document is a draft in progress and is for use only in disseminating information among the research team. All data is preliminary and has not been approved for use in publications by USGS or any other entity, as of 2023-04-12"
